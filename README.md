# lambda-calculus
It's easy to think that lambda calculus is not much more than a bizarre, impractical form of abstract math, but it is absolutely foundational to programming, not only providing a theoretical basis but also a rich set of simple, practical abstractions. Good abstractions are hard to come by; there seems to be an inverse relationship between simplicity and ease, so the plain but powerful lambda is an indispensable tool to the programmer.
